# Budget Tracker Starter Code

This project is a simple budget tracker. It has offline functionality using IndexedDB to save transaction data to the browser, which sends the data to a Mongo database when connection is restored. It additionally operates as a downloadable PWA, using a manifest.json and a simple service worker to cache important files.
